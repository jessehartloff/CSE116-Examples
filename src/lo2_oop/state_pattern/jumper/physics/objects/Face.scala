/**
  * Stores constants representing the different faces of a rectangular cuboid and in the physics engine. A seventh
  * face is defined to indicate the inside of an object.
  *
  * These constants will be used to communicate with which face an object is colliding allowing games to behave
  * differently based on the colliding face. For example, a game may want a player to land on a platform when
  * colliding with it's top, but move through the platform when colliding with the bottom, sides, or if the player
  * is already colliding with the platform (internal)
  *
  * Positive indicates the side that is facing in the positive direction along that axis.
